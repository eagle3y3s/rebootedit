<p>In the preface to this season we will continue to share some tree therapy feedback from brothers:</p>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Haha, Brother Feixiang (Soaring Eagle), tree therapy is really amazing! I persisted with it for about a week, and I felt
that my face became obviously brighter. My friends said that I look like a child now, hehe, thank you! So happy! It would be great if I had been exposed to rebooting a few years earlier. Why?! Regret.</p>
<p><strong>Additional comment:</strong> This brother has already experienced the magical effect of tree therapy. The change in brightness is obvious to him and his friends. Once it is turned on, the whole
person’s mental outlook will be lifted. In fact, there are other feelings, such as becoming cleaner, more delicate, and fuller, a series of subtle and good changes.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Brother Feixiang, today I held a willow tree on the campus of the school for a while. This time it felt quite obvious. I kept changing my cheeks and pasting on it because there were too many people coming and going, and I persisted for a long time, i.e. more than ten seconds. In total I did it for more than half an hour. After this time, the palms of both hands did feel a lot thicker. When you make a fist with both hands, there will be a fleshy feeling in the palms of your hands, and there will be some feeling on your face, just that the facial muscles are relaxed a lot. Whenever someone comes over, I play with my mobile phone with my back leaning on the tree, and I continue to practice after they have left. I think I will be able to stick to it. Brother Feixiang gives me strength, I will stick to it, ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>Additional comment:</strong> This feedback is from brother Yuanzhen. He felt the palm of his hand thicken, which happens after tree therapy. This thickening will be felt during tree therapy, but the most obvious feeling is a few hours after, especially at night. After washing one’s hands, one can feel the thickness of one’s palm. Thicker than right after the tree therapy, you can feel it when you feel it carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Case 3:</strong> I tried the tree therapy method you mentioned. There are many trees around my school. I chose a big
leaf banyan. I put my hand on the trunk. After a few minutes, I clenched my right hand into a fist and the strong feeling was actually great. Then I squeezed the fist of my left hand. I didn’t touch my left hand. The power was obviously inferior to the right hand. I changed my left hand to just touching. After a few minutes, my left hand actually felt very powerful. I want to say that the power of nature is really infinite.</p>
<p><strong>Additional comment:</strong> This brother’s case is very interesting, he felt very delicate. In fact, it replenishes wood qi. Traditional Chinese Medicine: <em>The liver is strong for the grip.</em> The liver corresponds to wood. So touching the tree with your palm for a period of time can increase your grip strength. This is a very subtle feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Tree therapy is very effective in improving appearance and complexion. Many brothers
have provided positive feedback. I hope more people will be able try it out. Find a clean tree and choose a quiet place with
few people. This is conducive to the practice. Usually, you should also pay attention to the way of health preservation. After nocturnal emission, after staying up late for a long time, after being tired, after looking at the computer for a long time, the skin complexion may appear to decline, so tree therapy should be done frequently, just like charging. Tree therapy has a miraculous effect on the restoration of appearance and complexion. The change is subtle yet obvious. When you really use your face to get close to trees, and hold on for a while, the miracle of recovery will take place. In addition, try not to do tree therapy too early or at night, because yin is very heavy during this time. It is best to wait for the sun to have risen and then to do tree therapy on the sunny side of the tree, that is, the side of the trunk that is directly exposed to the sun.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">44.1.1</span> 2 Q&amp;A cases<a href="in-depth-talks-about-rebooting-newcomers-and-emotional-management.html#qa-cases-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Flying brother (Soaring Eagle), help! I have a six to seven year history of masturbation. Last year, I felt that I could still get an erection. Then I started working. After I started working, I suddenly couldn’t make love anymore. Am I really sick? I am worried about impotence!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When the damage reaches a certain level, the evil results will appear, and there will be a process of quantitative change to qualitative change. Since you are working, you may not be exercising enough and/or you are most probably sitting for a long time. Sitting for a long time can damage your kidneys and easily damage your sexual function. I suggest that you persist in rebooting and maintaining good health, and actively exercise, so that your sexual function gradually improves. In addition, it is recommended to avoid pre-marital sex, pre-marriage intercourse belongs to adultery.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The evil effects of masturbation have an accumulation and lag period, just like water will not boil
until it reaches 100°. When the evil effects accumulate to a certain extent, they will appear. After the critical point, you will suffer. Once the symptoms come, you will suffer. In this case the trouble came. Some brothers were fine last year, but this year they collapsed. This collapse was not caused by one year. It was an overdraft for several years or even more than ten years. The evil effects of masturbation appear very quickly when the time has come. Even if some people have a good physique and love sports, their symptoms may not be obvious when they are young, but after the age of 40, various symptoms will
become very obvious. I started to pay for my indulgence in youth in middle age. After reaching the age of 40, the speed of recovery will slow down a lot, making it more difficult to recover. Therefore, reboot as early as possible, wake up early, and quit early. Don’t compromise with the demons. You must clear all kinds of misunderstandings in your brain and establish a righteous view of rebooting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong> [Teacher Feixiang (Soaring Eagle), the few times I broke the reboot, I reached climax in less than a minute, sometimes even less than ten seconds. I want to ask you if this is considered premature ejaculation. In addition, I saw a post saying that masturbation is different from making love. The poster said that he only ejaculates within ten seconds due to masturbation, but his making love time is completely normal, and that those making love ejaculations are psychological problems. I am really confused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This question was mentioned in my previous article. There is a certain difference between masturbatory premature ejaculation and making love premature ejaculation. For example, if someone pursues strong stimulation and fast ejaculation during masturbation, then he may just have masturbatory premature ejaculation while making love is normal. But some people who have masturbatory premature ejaculation, have even worse premature ejaculation when they make love. If you are not pursuing rapid ejaculation when masturbating, and only a
little stimulation leads to ejaculate, then the same is also likely to be the case when making love, and one will easily become nervous during this time. ML premature ejaculation is not always a psychological problem. Chinese medicine has talked about premature ejaculation and impotence caused by kidney deficiency. For example, some people don’t have premature ejaculation at first, but if they indulge to a certain degree, they will have premature ejaculation. This kind of situation is very common among married rebooting friends. For example, it is OK for a few years after being married, but premature ejaculation
occurs after a few years of indulgence. It is not a psychological problem. Of course, psychological problems can lead to premature ejaculation as well. For example, some people are very nervous and have a lot of psychological pressure on them, which can also cause premature ejaculation. How long can you be in control when you are in good health? It takes 10 minutes for some people and half an hour for others. But after a certain amount of indulgence, the time to orgasm becomes shorter, and the penis becomes very sensitive. It will ejaculate after ten seconds or even a touch, which means that the kidney qi is insufficient. Regarding whether ML premature ejaculation is equivalent to masturbation premature ejaculation, it depends on the specific situation. Some people have masturbatory premature ejaculation. ML premature ejaculation is more serious.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> When the injury reaches a certain level, weak erection, premature ejaculation and impotence will definitely occur. Regarding the injury of sexual function, there is no doubt, countless cases have fully confirmed this point. You can get energized right now, but it is actually your sexual function after overdraft. If you get an erection by taking medicine, it is using your last bit of kidney qi, and your body will break down faster in the future. Worrying about sexual dysfunction is a common among brothers, so we should take good care of rebooting and health, and avoid indulgence before marriage. This is very important. If you indulge too much before marriage, it will be embarrassing after marriage, so many people get divorced.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to the main topic. This season we will talk about rebooting newcomers and emotional management in depth.</p>
<p>If 100 brothers come to reboot almost all 100 of these brothers have been brainwashed by the theory of moderate harmlessness. I had been living under the influence of the theory of harmlessness in moderation since childhood. The theory of harmlessness has been deeply rooted in our collective mind. Therefore, many newcomers come to reboot, and their posts still carry a lot of the remnants of the theory of harmlessness in moderation. It is difficult for newcomers to change their minds quickly, so we can only advise them to learn more about
rebooting articles and constantly correct their knowledge and understanding. Otherwise, if one can’t change their mind, one won’t be able to quit completely. Even some older brothers still think about being moderate sometimes, and haven’t completely climbed out of that <em>moderately harmless</em> thought trap, and thus haven’t quit masturbation till now.</p>
<p>The first step in rebooting is to reform your ideology. Just like you go to jail to reform your mind, some people become better and reform, while some people still remain as they are and continue to commit crimes after serving time. When newcomers come to reboot, they are faced with just such a problem, because newcomers have a characteristic, that is, they are full of misunderstanding in their minds. You can tell whether they are newcomers by looking at the questions asked, and I can
tell whether they are newcomers by looking at the content of their posts. If one can quit, one will know which reboot level the other is at.</p>
<p>Many brothers don’t even understand the basic common sense that adultery is secretly leaking, and they still think that adultery is beautiful. If this is seen by senior brothers, they may shake their heads. The inability to quit is actually a misunderstanding in thinking and insufficient understanding. Newcomers come to reboot. If you really want to quit completely, you should calm
down and study rebooting articles, improve your rebooting knowledge a little bit, and raise your rebooting awareness bit by bit. Otherwise, if still thinking that it is harmless in moderation, you won’t be able to give up even after 10,000 years. The so-called <em>moderation theory</em> is basically self-deception.</p>
<p>The one who believes in <em>harmless in moderation</em> theories does not know how many people have been harmed by this theory. They all thought that they could be moderate, but masturbation is highly addictive. Have you considered it? Do you know that adultery is a secret leak? Symptoms are prone to occur after adultery. Do you really understand this common sense?
As long as a newcomer is willing to persist in studying rebooting articles, his thinking will be easily transformed. Studying rebooting articles is a process of reforming your mind and raising your consciousness. If you don’t reform your own thoughts well,
or leave the moderate harmlessness of the past, then you don’t want to give it up. What newcomers lack most is learning! What newcomers need most is learning! Otherwise, if one has a misunderstanding of and refuses to listen to reason and to learn, then seniors will have no choice but to let the symptoms tell one the truth. Someone who cannot climb out of the <em>moderately harmless</em> thought trap for the rest of their lives is sad. Once they fall in, they will be in it for the rest of their lives. Such a situation is really sad! He was captured by a wrong thought and
became a puppet of this kind of thought, but he didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with his thoughts, and that he was very self-righteous. This is the saddest thing about such a one.
Rebooting, many new people are wrong at the beginning, don’t want to give up completely, are still compromising with the demons, and still thinking about being moderate, with wrong motives, they are doomed to fail. The theory of <em>moderate harmlessness</em> does not leave the brain by itself. Only
rebooting can help you. If you don’t recognize the true nature of the theory of <em>moderate harmlessness</em>, you will not be able to reboot successfully. We must reboot thoroughly, including
adultery. Thorough rebooting is the path I choose to fly. I am a thorough person, and definitely not a compromiser. I hope that the newcomers will recognize the theory of <em>moderate
harm</em> as soon as possible, and do not break down in the future, and complain about the theory of <em>moderate harm</em>. There will be no point in complaining at that time. Take a look at the real cases of the predecessors. How many people have been ruined by the theory of <em>moderate harmlessness</em>?</p>
<p>Incalculable.</p>
<p>Do you know why some rebooting platforms do not allow newcomers to post? Because newcomers are full of misunderstandings in their minds, as soon as they come up without learning, they will be forced to quit. The mentality of rebooting is completely wrong, and they are still thinking about
quitting with will power, the result is constant failure. Newcomers have a wide range of ideological misunderstandings, and they are seriously brainwashed by the harmless theory, and it is difficult to correct them for a while, and they must be corrected through a large number of studies on rebooting articles. If you don’t have a correct understanding and knowledge of rebooting, you can’t get rid of it successfully. For example, some brothers like to say “Eating is like sex also”, and hold on to this sentence, thinking that they are very right, you know “Eating is like sex also”, then I ask you, do you know about “Paying the bill” after eating food?, there is no free lunch in the world.</p>
<p>Don’t think that masturbation is like eating, and then you indulge yourself and find an excuse for indulgence. In fact, it’s a big mistake. If you think like this you will go astray, you will go astray. The ancients said that sexuality is more about the need to pass on from generation to generation, it is righteousness after marriage, rather than asking you to indulge unscrupulously.
The ancients were firmly opposed to premarital sex!</p>
<p>In addition, newcomers are asked not to think too simply about rebooting. I mean thorough rebooting, including quitting adultery and not breaking the reboot. Thinking too simplistically will only give rise to the thought of underestimating the enemy. In fact, there are quite a lot of brothers who have underestimated the enemy. Afterwards, they even become proud. The so-called arrogant soldier will be defeated. Of course, we shouldn’t think about rebooting too hard. As long as we are
willing to keep our feet on the ground and raise our consciousness through continuous learning
our consciousness can be raise our consciousness through continuous learning we can subdue the demons. Some brothers may have gained a certain level of enlightenment through learning, which is much higher than that of newcomers, but their enlightenment has not yet reached the perfect place, and there are still flaws in their understanding. Such brothers will still break the reboot. Everyone should be humble and cautious when rebooting, avoid being proud and complacent. The higher the level of consciousness, the more vigilance is required. Instead of becoming proud and complacent when the level of consciousness is high be extra vigilant. If not the inner demon will take advantage of your loopholes, and if you are too self-confident, you will become blind and conceited. In the end it will only lead to a tragic result.</p>
<p>We hope that the newcomers will learn more from the mistakes of their predecessors and not repeat the tragedy of their predecessors. Let me tell you this. Almost all the predecessors had the same idea as you in the beginning. They thought that they were being <em>moderate</em> and eventually became wasted. Now you are the blind and ignorant me in the past. When you start to
study rebooting articles, you will continue to improve.</p>
<p>Enlightenment, will change your mind and consciousness and you will become who I am now. The predecessor’s painstaking realisation is that newcomers can wake up as soon as possible and step into the right path of rebooting. Rebooting is a pure land. I hope everyone will cherish their blessings. Please consciously stay away from the theory of <em>moderate harm</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Remember the bad times! Remember the damage!</strong></p>
<p>Let’s talk about emotional management:</p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong>
&gt;[Teacher Feixiang, I am learning all about rebooting knowledge you mention every day, but I am embarrassed that I relapse as usual. I always feel very depressed before a relapse. I don’t break the reboot in vain. I clean up my room over and over again. My room used to be very messy and looked like a doghouse. Now I help my mother with the housework when I have time. My room is clean, I listen to light music when I have time, and smile from time to time. I think rebooting knowledge only treats the symptoms, not the root cause. Whats most important is one’s state of mind, and calmness is the kingly way of rebooting.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a message from brother lefty. Lefty is a senior brother and has a high level of consciousness, but please remember one thing: **if a person breaks the reboot, then there must be a lack of understanding or a misunderstanding somewhere. What we have to do is to discover this <em>“deficiency”</em> if the reboot is broken, and then strengthen our understanding. To be successful in rebooting, one must constantly improve one’s understanding and bring it close to a perfect state. What is enlightenment? Enlightenment is to have a correct understanding and knowledge of rebooting. The deeper the understanding, the better it is and hence the greater the possibility of quitting. Otherwise, if you are full of misunderstandings or blind spots in your mind, you will definitely break the reboot. The shortcoming of brother Lefty lies in failure to emotionally manage oneself. I have seen countless cases of
brothers. Many have lost due to lack of emotional management. There are always contradictions and dissatisfaction in life, such as quarrels with parents, or with colleagues and friends.
Relationship tensions, things not going well, encountering great distress, etc., will affect a person’s emotions. When negative emotions arise, you must learn to manage emotions. Just
like a clock that goes too fast or too slow, one must adjust it to the correct time. This ability to adjust emotions is extremely critical for rebooting. Emotions can lead to relapse, especially bad emotions. Of course, carnal emotions can also lead to relapse. So it is best to maintain a stable emotional state.</p>
<p>Lefty separates rebooting knowledge and mentality adjustment. In fact, there is a misunderstanding here, because rebooting knowledge includes the adjustment of mentality. I have repeatedly emphasized the importance of emotional management in previous articles. You must immediately intervene when bad thoughts arise, otherwise these negative thoughts will distract you from yourself and control your behavior and lead to relapse. However, Lefty has realized the importance of emotional management, that is, the importance of mental adjustment through relapse, and hopes that
he can quit completely now. After passing the emotional management stage, rebooting will become very stable.</p>
<p>You don’t need to separate awareness from mentality or habits, because rebooting awareness includes developing good habits, such as not staying up late or loitering in bed after waking up. Enlightenment also includes adjusting your own mentality. Enlightenment is a general term, and all theories of successful rebooting can be included in this word, including vigilance awareness. <strong>Successful rebooting = high awareness + strong vigilance</strong>. The reason why I separate vigilance from is actually
to emphasize the importance of vigilance awareness. In fact, vigilance awareness also belongs to the general category of awareness.
Emotional management is an important distinction between brothers. Too many brothers die on the emotional level. After passing the emotional level, they will enter a new level of rebooting, otherwise they will not be able to pass the emotional level. The possibility of relapse is still very strong. Some brothers may have to break the reboot many times before they realize the importance of emotional management. Mental adjustment and emotional management actually mean the same thing. The experience posts I wrote are all my thoughts and understanding. Many brothers do not have deep experience, so reading my article may not lead to realization. When such a brother sees the words “emotional management”, he is not impressed. After being
abused by the heart demon countless times, he might suddenly realize that emotional management is actually crucial. It turns out that emotions can really lead to relapse. Only then does one realise the importance of emotional management.</p>
<p>We must learn to manage emotions when rebooting. Some brothers may ask, how to manage emotions? If you talk about emotional management in detail, you can write a book, but the content of a book can be summarized in two words, i.e. psychological suggestions. For example, if you are very upset in your heart, you can suggest to yourself <em>stay calm</em> and <em>don’t think too much about it</em>. You can also think of things that make you happy. I was neurotic at the time. I lived in depression and
despair every day. I even had suicidal thoughts. Later, I learned emotional management, especially when I felt depressed, I immediately thought of some relaxing comedy clips. And then I adjusted my mood, and now I adjust my emotions in the same way. There are many ways and techniques of psychological suggestion. You can also visualize selflessness, where the emotions and troubles come from the selfishness. If you empty yourself, you can naturally calm down the troubles of bad
emotions. You can also think in this way, using the theory of health preservation in Chinese medicine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Come to enlighten yourself, because anger hurts the liver, troubles cause yang, seven emotions cause illness, and bad emotions can lead to diseases</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we must learn to keep calm and conform to the way of health preservation as much as possible. We should not suppress bad
emotions. Strong pressure will damage our health. We can transform our emotions or make them empty so that we can pass the emotional barrier safely. Emotional management also includes motivating oneself like making oneself feel the emotion of forging ahead. Motivating oneself can effectively overcome the emotional laziness period of rebooting, and keep oneself in a state of courage and progress.</p>
<p>In addition, I want to emphasize that, try not to laugh excessively, because I have seen some brothers who say that they have to laugh every day. That is also not in line with the way of keeping good health. You can laugh knowingly, laugh in a restrained manner, and don’t need to laugh everyday. Laughter can lead to extreme joy and sorrow, and it can cause sudden death. There are two real cases in my experience. One was in the community chess room. An old man was playing mahjong and
caught a card, which made his hand the best possible hand. He then laughed and suddenly died on the spot. Another case was even worse. A 25-year-old young man who had just got married was in a state of laughing with his wife after eating. He died suddenly, and the ambulance came but they were helpless.
These two real cases remind us to try not to laugh excessively, but to laugh in a restrained manner, so as not to cause happiness or sorrow.</p>
<p>Brothers with common sense of Chinese medicine will know that people who indulge in sexual desire are likely to have heart problems, because the kidney is the root of the five internal organs, and if the kidney is weak to a certain extent, premature heart palpitations and even cardiac neurosis may occur. Some brothers come to reboot, and they are likely to have such an idea: <em>How is it that all the symptoms apply to masturbation?!</em> In fact, if one has a deep understanding one would not think so. <strong>Chinese medicine</strong>: The kidney is the root of the five internal organs, and if the kidney is small, disease is possible. These are the truths of Chinese medicine. After thousands of years of
verification, it is not a misunderstanding that we attribute all the mentioned symptoms to masturbation. If your understanding is limited, or experience is not deep, it is likely to be misunderstood. Of course, there are many pathogenic factors. Exogenous factors, dietary factors, emotional factors, bad living
habits, such as staying up late for a long time, long gazing, overwork etc. can all cause symptoms, and poor congenital physical fitness is also a factor. If multiple pathogenic factors work together, the sperm injury will be more serious. The
way to hurt the essence is not just masturbation. Staying up late, getting angry, sitting for a long time, etc. will all deplete the essence of the kidney, so we must pay attention to the way of health preservation.</p>
<p>Based on my studies and understanding, I will share with you the specific methods of emotional management. We must do a good job in emotional management and be the master of our emotions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Confirm the current emotions</strong>: When you have negative emotions, such as anger, depression, decadence, despair, etc., you have to realize that the negative emotions have appeared. The first step is to discover and confirm the negative emotions, just like finding the enemy.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer the bad emotions:</strong> When you realize that you are experiencing bad emotions, like being shrouded by dark clouds, you have to learn to transfer bad emotions. You can fold a paper ball, imagine that the bad emotions are wrapped in it, and then throw it into the trash can.</li>
<li><strong>Replace with good emotions:</strong> When you realize that bad emotions have appeared, immediately think of happy things, such as a happy experience, a good memory, or a joke, so that you can get rid of the negative emotions immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Void yourself:</strong> You can visualize that there is no self, where the emotions and troubles come from without self, everything is a mediocre self-disturbing, emptiness of yourself, so that negative emotions can not find a target.</li>
<li><strong>Vent negative emotions:</strong> You can eliminate bad emotions through appropriate exercise, such as playing basketball, or going for a walk, or watching movies and listening to songs.</li>
<li><strong>Motivate yourself:</strong> Affirm your progress, say words that motivate yourself, listen to motivational songs, watch motivational movies, and re-burn your fighting spirit.</li>
<li><strong>Do more charitable deeds:</strong> helping others is the basis of happiness. When you are in a bad mood, you can try to do some small deeds, such as cheering for brothers online, and giving positive energyto them, so that you can also adjust your emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Health awareness:</strong> Realizing that negative emotions can cause illness, why should we indulge in it? It’s like slashing yourself with a knife, and immediately stopping the negative emotions means you stop hurting yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Keep smiling:</strong> Smile, it is one of the most beautiful expressions. It implies that you are optimistic, keep smiling, and live every day positively and optimistically. There is no obstacle that can’t be overcome, and the key lies in attitude.</li>
<li><strong>Relax yourself:</strong> Don’t be too hard on yourself, you will collapse if you are too hard, learn to relax yourself, take a hot bath, do health-preserving exercises, don’t think too much, and get away from your worries.</li>
</ol>

<p>Emotional management means that we can choose emotions. Emotions are like supermarket goods. We can choose. When negative emotions appear, we should be aware of it immediately. Then we can choose good emotions instead of letting negative emotions take control.
Negative emotions are actually negative thoughts. For those thoughts, we must also realize that when we think about them, we should not be controlled by negative emotions.
Once controlled by negative emotions, it is easy to break the reboot. In the final analysis, to reboot is to learn to observe thoughts, recognize thoughts, and manage ideas. We study rebooting articles to improve our consciousness, the ultimate goal is to improve our ability to control thoughts. For example, if a person has 300 thoughts a day, which thoughts are likely to lead to relapse, you should be aware of, such as negative emotions, obscene thoughts, instigated thoughts, carnal thoughts, thoughts of doubts about rebooting, or future doubts etc. In short, we can see there are many thoughts that lead to relapse, and some thoughts are well-disguised, such as the thoughts of instigation. For thoughts, we should be an observer, and identify which thoughts are problematic and which thoughts are likely to lead to relapse. Once such thoughts appear, we must immediately intervene and cure them. It’s like setting up a checkpoint on the road to let thoughts pass one by one, but the problematic thoughts cannot pass. Once you let the problematic thought pass the checkpoint, it will dominate your behavior, because thoughts lead to behavior, <strong>Thoughts → Behavior!</strong> Once the problematic thought has passed, it will lead to relapse. Let us be a thought observer, let us be a thought master!</p>

<p><strong>“The Bardo, Hearing and Teaching”</strong>, <em>written by Padmasambhava.</em>
I highly recommend this book. If you get this book, it is a treasure. Of course, there are many people who are
unfamiliar with these works, even if they see them, they will miss them. This book has a graphic version. The graphic version is more intuitive. What I recommend is the explanation version of the vowel old man, using Sun Jingfeng’s translation. There are several editions of this book. I prefer Sun Jingfeng’s edition. It is perfect with the explanation of the old man with vowels. The vowel old man’s documents on the bardo teachings can be found on Baidu. After downloading, you can print them out and read them. There are also books to buy on the Internet. I hope those who are destined will not miss this precious text.</p>

<h3>A tree therapy case<a href="in-depth-talks-about-rebooting-newcomers-and-emotional-management.html#a-tree-therapy-case" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been doing tree therapy for about two weeks now, and for at least half an hour a day. I hug a ginkgo tree. It is indeed effective. The skin becomes smooth and fair after hug the tree, but it will reverts after a while. I used to use the computer for a long time every day. Is this why my skin doesn’t look good? How can I keep the fairness and exquisiteness after tree therapy?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: This brother practiced tree therapy and chose ginkgo trees. I am work with camphor trees and ginkgo trees. Ginkgo trees are generally cleaner and warmer. The effect is better is usually better and more pronounced. Of course, the effect is more apparent right after finishing the procedure, but this brother’s awareness of health maintenance is very poor. Long periods of time staring at the computer will result in “screen face”, which will counteract the effect of tree
therapy. Sitting for a long time also hurts the kidneys and the spleen, and long-term staring hurts the liver. If you stay up late playing games, the damage will be even worse. Staying up late will hurt your complexion and will lead to endocrine disorders, dark circles under the eyes or aggravation of acne.
Therefore, when we are doing tree therapy, we must pay attention to the way of health, and strictly control the emission of spermatorrhea. The positive effects of doing tree therapy for 3 days is neutralized by a single occurence of spermatorrhea. Also, tree therapy should be a consistent practice. It is best to
do it for atleast an hour, and more than 2 hours is even better. Of course, it is not necessary to stand for 2 hours at a time. You can have a tree therapy rest session and then continue. Be flexible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brothers who don’t have time can do it for at least half an hour each time, and they can listen to songs when they are bored. In addition, you should pay attention to safety when doing tree therapy. The surrounding wild life can be dangerous and could have snakes. Also don’t do it by the river, especially a river without guardrails as you may fall into the river accidentally. Choosing the right trees and the right environment is very important. Try not to go to uninhabited places. You can be in a relatively quiet place with a few people. Anyway, the people don’t know you. After a long time, your skin will become thicker. It doesn’t matter. Habits start to make things feel natural. The effect of tree therapy is good, but it also depends on whether you have the faith, the time, and a suitable environment. Those who insist on practising with faith will surely experience the magical effect of tree therapy. It is completely natural and completely free of artificial cosmetics.</p>

<h3>Rebooting couple<a href="in-depth-talks-about-rebooting-newcomers-and-emotional-management.html#rebooting-couple" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I could be considered as a long time rebooter, about 10 years ago, after reading your articles, I felt a lot of emotion. I agree with you very much. Quitting is a must, but I have a few questions to ask you. First, you said that you had prostatitis but you completely recovered after one year of abstinence. Did you get a result from an examination report that you have recovered or is it that you personally feel that your symptoms have recovered? If you go to get a check up, could you send your report to us to look at? Second, you said that you had premature
ejaculation and severe impotency before, and so, till now you have quit for 3 years. Your article “rebooting as the best remedy” also mentioned that you recovered in about a year. What
verification is there for the recovery of this symptom? Since you haven’t broken the reboot for more than 3 years, how do you know that the correct function is restored? Third, I would like to know under what conditions do I need to take medicine + reboot all the time, and in what situation can I just reboot + exercise + dietary supplements?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>
1. The symptoms of prostatitis have all disappeared after persisting in rebooting and keeping in good health for more than a year. After reviewing the prostatic fluid, the indicators have all become completely normal. Insist on rebooting and maintaining health, actively exercising, you will slowly recover. There are posts on alleviating recovery in the forum. You are a newcomer. If you read more to increase your experience, you will no longer have doubts.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The proof of recovery can be seen from the quality of morning erection, it is not necessary to try, if one’s consciousness is not high, it is very likely to lead to going out of control and starting to indulge in masturbation again. I have talked about this in “Rebooting as a Good Medicine”. I have also talked about this issue in several quarters of articles. I suggest you take a closer look. In addition, there are also cases of recovery from premature ejaculation and impotence. Last season I took a screenshot of a real case of recovery from premature ejaculation. There are many cases of recovery from premature ejaculation and impotence. Brother Jiaxing has a lot of experience and he knows a lot. When a person has recovered, he himself has experience in recovery. If you insist on rebooting and keeping
good health, premature ejaculation and impotence are expected to disappear. Some brothers will try it, but I will not try it because I don’t want to break the vow just to try.</p></li>
<li><p>Severe symptoms or persistent symptoms require active medical treatment, 30% treatment, 70% health cultivation. Complete abstinence is necessary, otherwise it is easy to
relapse. Keep on! It is normal for newcomers to have a lot of questions. If you have deep experience, there is no problem answering them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Newcomers will inevitably have many questions. In fact, I have answered these three questions countless times. Many newcomers feel that prostatitis is irreversible because they have limited experience and have not met people who have really recovered. How many of the pre-chronic patients really completely quit? It is all relieved or temporarily cured with medication that has to be used on a continued basis, and the patient keeps relapsing. Over time, it is concluded that prostatitis is lifelong and cannot be cured. In fact, this view is biased. There are people who have been cured, but you have not met them. If you haven’t met these recovered people, saying that one can’t heal, is a biased view point. Many people are abstaining from sex, but do not pay attention to health
maintenance, and the frequency of spermatorrhea cannot be controlled. As a result, the recovery is not satisfactory. After more than a year, they still cannot recover. This is actually a poor recovery.
Those who truly recovered completely abstained from sex, strictly control spermatorrhea and have their own systematic health and recovery methods, so that they can positively expect
recovery. Both rebooting and health maintenance must be in place. Many brothers suffer from long-term injuries, and recovery is relatively slow. At this time, they need to be patient, be preparedfor a protracted battle, work hard to maintain their health, and be psychologically prepared to face the recurring period of symptoms. To be honest, many brothers are not completely abstaining from sex. They can’t control adultery, and they don’t have awareness of health preservation. In this
way, talking about recovery is like a dream. There are many misunderstandings in rebooting and recovery thinking. If you don’t figure it out, the result will be like entering a maze, and you may not be able to stay with it for a lifetime.</p>
<p>The improvement of the quality of morning erection is a sign of recovery of premature ejaculation and impotence. However, some brothers have almost no morning erection, but at the same time they do not have premature ejaculation and impotence. This situation also exists. In fact, their kidney qi is already in an insufficient state if they do not have morning erection. If the overdraft continues, their sexual function is likely to encounter problems. The quality of morning erection fluctuates and is related to the season, diet, exercise and other factors. A relatively stable and high-quality morning erection is an indicator of the recovery of sexual function. You can refer to this indicator to observe the recovery. If you are always thinking about trying, it is the heart demon who is urging you. If you quit for recovery of sexual function only, then the reboot will not last long, because you will always want to try. Recovery of the body? Generally, brothers who insist on rebooting and keeping in good health for a period of time will find that their morning erection has disappeared. This is actually a manifestation of the
recovery of kidney qi. At the beginning of rebooting, morning erection may disappear for a while. It is a withdrawal reaction. Some new people don’t understand, they are prone to panic and relapse, thinking that abstinence is harmful. In fact, this is a withdrawal reaction. It will slowly return to normal. When the quality of morning erection is very good, it means that your sexual function can be restored quite well. It is like a balloon, which is filled with kidney qi. From the quality of morning erection, you can see the recovery of your kidney qi, and sexual function. The recovery of kidney qi is closely related to sexual functions. Therefore, the recovery of sexual function can be seen from the quality of morning erection. High-quality morning erection is a good indicator of kidney qi recovery, and a high-quality morning erection that not short-lived, needs a
certain degree of rebooting stability. Just like you hit 10 points (darts) by chance, is that your true level? Some people
fired ten shots, and more than seven shots were all 10 points, while some people fired ten shots, only one shot had 10 rings, and the average was also not good.</p>
<p>Some people have good morning erection immediately after eating foods or drugs that promote sexual desire. It’s like athlete doping. They run very fast when they are doping, but they
slow down if they don’t. It’s not their real strength. Kidney Qi needs to be brought back slowly. It is not immediately replenished with a few Chinese medicines. Yao Ming did not grow to 2.26 meters in one night, it is a process of slow accumulation. Chinese medicine says: <em>It is better to lie alone when taking medicine</em>. Take a hundred Chinese medicines, it is still better to sleep all night by yourself. This means that you don’t sleep with your wife, but if you share the same room, the effect of a hundred Chinese medicines is nullified. During the developmental period, many people have high-quality morning erections every day. As we age, the frequency and quality of
morning erection will decrease to varying degrees, and will even disappear completely. Generally, if you insist on rebooting and keeping healthy for a period of time, morning erections will appear. When you get older, your kidney qi can’t be as full as when you were a teenager, so you must take care of it.</p>
<p>Regarding the article I wrote before, I said that I fully recovered. Based on the principle of seeking truth from facts, there is no need to lie to you. For example, gray hair, alopecia etc have all returned to normal. Now there are only a few white hairs. Previously there were a lot of them. Excluding the back of the head, there are dozens of them on each side. The manifestation of symptoms. I still pay attention to maintenance, because after sitting for a long time, staying up late, tired or having spermatorrhea, there is still a possibility of relapse. It is not a
<em>“one and done”</em> recovery, because there is more than one way to hurt the sperm. As far as I am concerned, the recovery situation is relatively stable. Until now, I have basically never relapsed, because I strictly control <em>suicide</em> and have not relapsed. In addition, I pay great attention to the way of keeping good health, so as to minimize the probability of recurrence.
My rhinitis has recovered much more than before. I rarely suffer from rhinitis. This is inseparable from the work of moxibustion. Hemorrhoids have also been cured by moxibustion. All of these
have recovered. Although the rhinitis has not been completely cured, it is already very good. It’s much better than before. Restoration is a systematic project. I have put a lot of effort into
restoration. I can get back to what I am now, and I am relatively satisfied. I will share my experience with you, and hope that everyone will be able to return to a satisfactory state as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>Some brothers may think that medical proof is needed to prove that health has been restored. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. Many functional problems cannot be detected at all. Just like it is with many neurotic patients, they are already dead and want to commit suicide every day. They have many physical symptoms, but when they go to the hospital for an examination nothing is found, and family members even suspect that one is pretending to be sick. Some brothers go to the hospital to check prostate fluid and the results are completely normal, but the symptoms of frequent urination and urgency are obvious. Some functional problems are just not detectable by examinations. Medical
instrument examinations have certain limitations. For this reason, there have been many misunderstandings and contradictions between doctors and patients. The patient feels that he is sick,but the doctor says you are not sick because the examination report is normal. What can you say? After all, they are doctors, so you can’t refute them. Later, many patients switch to Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine doctors know where your body is out of balance just by taking your pulse. With Chinese medicine conditioning and health maintenance, your body slowly returns to normal. Chinese and Western medicine have their own strengths. Don’t blindly believe in inspection reports. Normal inspection does not mean complete health. Many problems cannot be detected.</p>
<p>Many newcomers are not firmly confident in rebooting, which has a lot to do with feeling that they have no hope of recovery. Because they can’t see any hope of recovery, they give up on
themselves. They doubt the recovery of others and feel weird. In fact, they are ignorant. Their experience is still shallow. Some brothers are shaken as soon as they experience recurring
symptoms and think that they did not recover, as a result they relapse again. When this happens it means that on the one hand, their awareness/consciousness is insufficient, and on the other hand, the root of faith was not strong at the beginning. If the root is not strong, it is easy to retreat. Confidence is the
source of success. If you don’t believe that you can recover, how can you have the motivation to stick with it?</p>
<p>Many brothers have made a big fuss on the issue of “testing”, including many senior brothers, when the idea of “testing” appears in their minds, such as testing concentration and sexual function.</p>
<p><strong>!Remember!</strong>
<strong>Once this kind of thought arises, you must be extra vigilant, because it is the inner demon who is urging you to try, and the inner demon is very cunning and especially good at inciting.</strong></p>
<p>Many brothers are not sufficiently enlightened or relax their vigilance. Once they get the idea of <strong>“testing”</strong>, they will try
it immediately. Once they try, they will fall back into the trap.</p>

<p>In this season I will share my recovery secrets from the “bottom of the box” as it were. These are very good for the physical recovery of patients with sperm injury, especially for neurosis brothers. I hope you will not miss the content of this season.</p>
<p>In a very early article, I suggested that you stand up or meditate, and you should combine dynamic and static health regimens, so that you can cultivate good health and stability of mind. Static power is very important. Light movement is not static, light movement still does not conform to the way of keeping good health.</p>
<p>This season I will talk about the importance of static exercises, mainly about standing piles. The health piles I recommend are high-position piles, not Siping horses, or wall squatting. What I
recommended before was Wu Guozhong’s health-preserving pile.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from Wu Guozhong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I practiced Chinese traditional martial arts since I was a child, specifically Dachengquan. There are no tricks and routines in this type of boxing. It’s just <strong>‘hold your hands in front of your chest and stand quietly’</strong>. This action is called <strong>‘Zhan Zhuang’</strong> in martial arts. Application of this method, which is derived from martial arts, to health maintenance and curing diseases is called the <strong>“holding health”</strong> health maintenance method. So far, I have found that this health care method that integrates health
maintenance, traditional Chinese medicine, and martial arts is actually all the current physical and mental exercises. The simplest and most effective of the methods. The founder of Dachengquan, Mr. Wang Xiangzhai, was extremely weak at the age of seven or eight, and suffered from intractable asthma. There was no good way to cure this disease at the time. In desperation, the famous Xingyiquan master, Mr. Guo Yunshen, who had the reputation of <em>“Half-step collapse fist
hits the world”</em> in the martial arts, taught him the secret of Xingyiquan-standing and keeping health. Mr. Wang Xiangzhai used this kind of health cultivation technique to restore his body. Not only did he heal his illness, but he also unknowingly gained a lot of strength in his body. There is no need to guard the dantian when practicing the ‘Holding Health’ regimen, and there is no need to get rid of all distracting thoughts. Think of more pleasant things because this makes the heart happy and a slight joy is
better than any other medicine to nourish the heart. At this time, we are relaxed and carefree. Look, before long, you will You will taste the joy of the body.”
—Wu Guozhong “Living to the End”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect of Wu Guozhong’s health-preserving pile is very good. In fact, it is a martial art exercise,which has both health-preserving and martial arts functions. Many people in the health-preserving world are also practicing this pile. The essence of Chinese traditional martial arts lies in the
standing stance.</p>
<p><strong>“To wash the bone marrow, start with the standing stance.”</strong></p>
<p>A hundred trainings are not as good as one station. Zhan Zhuang is highly valued in the martial arts world, and it is not an exaggeration to describe it as extremely important. My previous articles have always recommended this practice to brothers, and many brothers have received good results. But there is a tiring part of this pile of work, which is, holding your hands, it feels like holding a balloon. Feeling loose. Wu Guozhong’s method is of course very good, but this season I want to recommend another health-preserving pile, and the effect is also very good, that is, the Ziwu health-preserving pile. Read the following:</p>
<p><strong>Standing in the Zi Meridian Gate</strong>: Raise the two forearms at the waist, 90 degrees to the upper arm, parallel to the two forearms, straddle one step to the left with the left leg shoulder-width apart, sink the shoulders and drop the elbows, with chest drawn back, head straight, Baihui and perineum are in a straight line, the lower jaw is slightly retracted, the tongue is topped with the upper palate, the lips are slightly closed, the whole body relaxes, intends to guard the pubic area, and breathes against the abdomen to gradually achieve a long and uniform breathing. Standing time depends on age and physical condition. It depends, from short to long, strive to reach more than 30 minutes each time. First of all, the Laogong acupoint starts to heat up, numbs and beats to the dantian fever, that is, there is a sense of qi. As long as the practitioner has good physical fitness and the practice time is long, the whole body’s meridians can be opened up in a short time. After practicing Zi-meridian exercises for 3 days, I felt a sense of qi. After 10 days, I felt my energy
doubled. After a hundred days, I can release my internal qi and reduce my external qi.</p>
<p>The health-preserving pile belongs to internal cultivation and belongs to the internal strengthening. Strength training belongs to external strength. Many people who practice bodybuilding are actually strong from the outside. The muscles look scary from the outside. In fact, they are weak inside. Being strong does not mean being healthy. Recently, there was news that the former
national bodybuilding champion Long Yunlei has leukemia. Originally, he had a stroke and then leukemia. Although he was only 35 years old, his fate was really miserable. Can you imagine a person who is as strong as a cow and has a stroke? Can you imagine people who are several times stronger than you get leukemia? I remember that a few years ago, a bodybuilding champion in Beijing, named Bao Pucheng, died suddenly at the age of 36 years. So being strong does not mean being
healthy, but being strong does make you feel healthy. This is a superficial feeling, just like some apples look good on the surface, but after biting them, they are all rotten inside. The superficial phenomenon is deceptive. A strong body may not necessarily lead to a long life.</p>
<p>Another example, Paul Anderson, the sun god in the power world, squatted more than 1,200 pounds, and only lived to 62 years old. Only lived to be 62 years old. Many old men squat no more than 50 kilograms and easily live past 80 years old. Therefore, keeping in good health is really the key, and exercise should be done in moderation. There are three levels of
exercise: <strong>nourishment, exhaustion, and injury</strong>. Health-preserving exercises belong to nourishment, sweating aerobic exercises and even strength training belong to exhaustion. Excessive exhaustion is an injury. Traditional Chinese Medicine: <strong>Sweating and hurting Yang! Sweat and hurt!</strong></p>
<p>Young people can afford to get hurt a bit, they don’t feel it. If your body is relatively weak however, you should choose to walk without sweating or slightly sweating, and practice more health maintenance techniques. When the body is almost recovered, you can do some strength training appropriately.</p>
<p>Speaking of my connection with the Ziwu Health Pillar, it was relatively early in my school days when I first discovered it. I remember I saw an introduction to the Ziwu Health Pillar in a magazine in the second year of the junior high. I read that it belongs to the category of Liangshan Kungfu. At that time, I used to be very angry and by doing this practice my energy doubled. Hence, I was very interested. Then I got the book “Liangshan Kungfu” through mail order. There is still a lot of content in the book, but I didn’t practice anything else, so it was a bit rushed.</p>
<p>This posture does not require the arms to be held up. Instead, the palms of the hands are facing upwards, and the empty fists are closed at the waist. It is a relatively simple posture, and it is also a high post. Squatting is fine, but be careful not to exceed your toes over your knees. At that time, I got angry very fast during practice, especially the feeling on my hands was obvious, and the energy really became very good, and the doubling of energy is definitely not a false statement.</p>
<p>Everyone may think, is the health-preserving pile is really so magical? In fact, the human body hasits own drugs, but unfortunately many people don’t even know it. This season I will talk about this great medicine carefully with you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After knocking the teeth, saliva is produced, and saliva is kidney fluid. Saliva, swallow 30 times. A mouthful of saliva is equivalent to a box of Liuwei Dihuang Wan.
– <strong>Qu Limin</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The human body’s own medicine is the saliva in our mouth, but not ordinary saliva. It is the saliva secreted after knocking the teeth. The saliva secreted after knocking the teeth is very beneficial to the human body.</p>
<p>Qu Limin said it is equivalent to a box of Liuwei Dihuang pills. And the big medicine I’m talking about is not the saliva secreted after tapping the teeth, but an upgraded version of the tapping saliva, which is the saliva secreted by the tongue against the upper palate, and the tongue against the upper palate means that the tongue is against the upper palate. In qigong studies, this is considered to be a bridge between the two channels of the governor, commonly known as <em>“the bridge of magpies”.</em></p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the Governing Vessel runs through the back,and the Governor’s body is surrounded by Yang Vessels, which is the sea of Yang Vessels; Ren Vessel runs along the abdomen, always has any Body Yin Vessel, which is the Sea of Yin Vessels.</p>
<p>The tongue can reach the upper palate to communicate with the two channels of Ren and Du, so that the meridians of the whole body are connected, and the upper and lower air flow is unblocked. Frequent practice of this exercise can clear the blood, strengthen the meridian, refresh the mind, and strengthen the physique.</p>
<p>The two points of Jinjin and Yuye, and the multiple fluids of Zangjin are well known by doctors. The two acupoints, commonly known as “Hua Chi Water”, are tied to the lungs and rooted in the kidneys. The acupoints are on the left and right under the tongue, the tongue is the seedling of the heart, the foot Shaoyin kidney meridian holds the tongue, and the spleen meridian of the foot Taiyin disperses under the tongue, so the two acupoints are not only related to the lung and kidney, but can nourish the spleen and yin. Mutual aid with the kidney water, inducing the kidney water to suppress the heart and fire, and combining the spleen and soil to nourish the lung.</p>
<p>Cheng Guopeng said that this “water of Huachi” can be used to treat the loss of true yin and the symptoms of yin deficiency and fire, and praised it as “the perfect prescription for curing yin
deficiency.”</p>
<p>Fang Zai “Medical Mind Enlightenment”, the method is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Often use the tongue to touch the palate, fill the mouth with the water from the Huachi, so that the body is soothed, and send it to the dantian with the mind and eyes, and the mouth will be repeated. Three times, this is called the “swallowing body fluid” method. This is to divert the water from the Huachi Lake to delay the execution of the fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Su Wen” says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All people with chronic kidney disease can face south at the
same time, clean the mind without chaos, and stop breathing without breathing seven times, so as to induce the throat and breathe smoothly, such as a hard pharynx. After seven times, There are countless energies under the bait’s tongue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the method of drawing water from Huachi to nourish kidney yin, and regenerating through gold and water. The above-mentioned tongue touches the upper palate and draws the fluid under the tongue and swallows, namely, the two points of Jinjin
and Yuye are hidden. This method of inducing pharyngeal fluids originated from the Dan family. The original intent was to maintain health, and later to use it to treat diseases. It conforms to medical theory and conforms to nature. The method is simple and effective. I pay attention and observe that in healthy infants and young children, the tongue often touches the palate and the
scrotum is often tightened. This is the mutual growth of yin and yang. The tongue is the seedling of the heart, and it stores the golden fluid and jade liquid; the front yin is the orifice of the kidney and embodies the true Qi and Yuanyang.</p>
<p>The power of this “Hua Chi Water” is really extraordinary. It is a great medicine for the human body. It is very good for the recovery of the body and the recovery of neurosis. The effect is very fast and energy is improved significantly</p>
<p>Taoism often refers to body fluid as jade liquid, jade jelly, liquan, spiritual liquid, etc. It is believed that this liquid is produced by refining qi and is the essence of the five internal organs, sweet and fragrant. If people practice diligently and rinse their throat fluids, they can prevent diseases and strengthen their bodies. The “Huang Ting Jing” says: Yuchi’s clear water is filled with spiritual roots, and the spiritual roots are strong and old. The “External Scene Jing” also attaches great importance to the role of body fluids, such as “Yuchi clear water can irrigate spiritual roots, and the repair can last forever.” Open both ears up and down, peek into the heaven and the earth to save the boy, blend the essence and treat the hair and teeth, the color and luster will not be white.”</p>
<p>Regarding rebooting and health preservation, the “Tai Ping Sutra” advocates that “If you want to live a long life, you should respect the spirit.</p>
<p>“The”External Scene Jing” also emphasizes the meaning of solid essence and precious essence. Go old and rejuvenate”.</p>
<p>When I meditate or stand, I usually touch my tongue to my palate. Within 5 minutes, the Huachi water will come down. It tastes different from ordinary saliva and has a sweet and delicate
fragrance. Then I swallow it, which is equivalent to “eating elixir”. This is really a free elixir produced by the human body. It is a pity that many people don’t know it at all, and they are still seeking medicine. In fact, they have a treasure, but they don’t know. When you stand or meditate, you will have delusional thoughts at the beginning of the practice. You can use the counting-breath
method to contemplate. Regarding the problem of keeping the orifice, the Ziwu health-preserving pile means keeping the pubic area, while I myself keep the pubic area, that is, the position of the eyebrows. One is prone to nocturnal emission in the pubic area, and one is also prone to nocturnal emission if meditating before going to bed. Moreover, there is also a law-abiding method. You can’t keep it strong, but “know but not keep, save first and forget.” Don’t keep strong. Strong defense is easy to go wrong. Or you can keep nothing, just focus on counting your breath. A mouthful of Huachi water can be swallowed in several mouthfuls, but there is also a knack for swallowing it, and it is perfect with the sixteen-character ingot gold.</p>
<p>What is sixteen-character ingot gold?</p>
<p>Taoist Qigong Health Preserving 16-character Ingot Gold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you inhale, you lift up, the qi returns to the navel, and when you lift it, you swallow. The fire and water meet each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the Taoist sixteen-character ingot gold produced during the Song and Yuan dynasties.</p>
<p>It was first seen in Leng Qian’s <em>“Xiuling Must Refer to the 16-character Jue for Longevity”</em> in the early Ming Dynasty. From the emergence of Taoism at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty to the appearance of the sixteen-character ingot gold, it took more than a thousand years.</p>
<p>Sixteen gold ingots, also known as Li Zhenren’s 16-character Jue for Longevity, is a representative exercise of Taoist health preservation. The sixteen-character words are “lifting when inhaling, returning qi to the umbilical cord, swallowing when lifting, meeting water and fire”. This method was first recorded in Leng Qian’s “The Essentials of Xiu Ling” in the Ming Dynasty, and he praised it as a most simple and easy trick. Later, “RedPhoenix Marrow”, “Eight Notes of Zunsheng”,
“Maiwang”, “Secret Records of Health Preservation”, “Medical Prescriptions” etc. all introduced this method.</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty health regiment Leng Qian’s explanation of this in <em>“Xiu Ling Yao Zhi”</em> is different, calling this sixteen-character ingot gold <em>“long life 16-character magic
formula”</em> and <em>“simple and easy magic formula”</em>. He pointed out that this trick is more practical, feasible everywhere, and everyone can practice it and introduced the cultivation method in a popular way. This is recorded below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must rinse your mouth three or five times with your
tongue. The tongue stirs the upper and lower palate, and the tongue is still on the palate. The mouth is full of fluid, swallowed again and again, and there is a murmur. Take a breath in the nose to express yourself. Reaching the heart, silently send it straight to the three-inch Dantian Yuanhai below the belly button, and save a little, which is called a suck. With the lower part gently like a poop, lift it with will force to return to the umbilicus, even And Jiaji Shuangguan Kidney Gate is lifted all the way to the back of the jade pillow pass, penetrates into the top of the mud pill, it rises up, and does not feel the qi comes out, it is called a breath. The qi rises, and then swallows as if it was a murmur, inhales the clear breath, and sends it to the dantian for a while, and then gently lifts it up from the bottom as before, and connects with the umbilicus, the so-called qi Return to the umbilical cord, longevity and heaven are together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, Zhan Zhuang can treat frequent dysfunction. Brothers who are troubled by frequent dysfunction can also try Zhan Zhuang and eat more “Elixir”. The human body has its own medicine, so do the practice. Taoist Tian Chengyang said that standing upright can strengthen the body and replenish qi.</p>
<p>Regarding the role of Huachi Water, some texts are excerpted below for your reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pharyngeal fluid function: Yanjin health preservation has a long history in our country. The ancients called it “fetal eclipse”, which refers to throat fluid. “Han Wu Nei Chuan” said: “Xi gushes the tongue under the spring and swallows it, the name is fetal food.” The doctors of the past have realized that the body fluid in the mouth is a precious substance that is beneficial to human health
and longevity and should be swallowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sun Simiao, a great medical practitioner of the Tang Dynasty, said in “Qianjin Yaofang Volume 27”: “Yuquan people have saliva in their mouths. Before the dynasty, gargle early to make the
mouth full and swallow it.” Traditional medicine is about pharyngeal fluid health. “Lingshu Tiannian”, “Suwen Needle Method”, etc. all talk about the important role of
“blood fluid” and “bait swallowing fluid” on human health and the method of pharyngeal fluid. The pre-Qin “Zihuazi” said: “The journey of Rongwei and Wei will not fail, the six fu organs will
transform the valley, and the liquid will be spread, so it can last for a long time without harm.” Unearthed at the end of 1973, “Tian Xia Zhi” “Tao Tan”, which explains the “eight benefits” of
health preservation in the house, talks about the health preservation function of “swallowing body fluid”. All these show that the ancients of our country discovered the function of saliva in the human body very early, which is consistent with the research and discussion of modern science.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Taoist health practitioners call the saliva produced in the process of practicing the “gold liquid to
return to the dantian” (see “Golden Pills”). This kind of saliva has many nice names: Jinjiangyuli,
Lingye, Shenshui, Liquan, Jinjin, Yuye, Jinli, Yujin, Yuchi Qingshui, Yuxi, Sublingual Spring and
so on. The ancients believed that swallowing this body fluid is good for health preservation. Ming
Dynasty medical scientist Li Shizhen, in his book “Compendium of Materia Medica Volume 52”,
made the following explanation of “Kou Jin saliva”: “There are four orifices under the tongue.
Liquid. The heart air flows into the tongue as the divine water, and the kidney juice flows into the
sublingual as the spiritual liquid. Taoists call it golden jade liquor, overflowing as Liquan, gathering
into Huachi, dispersing as body fluid, and reducing to nectar, so it irrigates the viscera and
moisturizes the limbs. Therefore, to cultivate the family’s throat and qi, it is called clear water to
irrigate the spirit root. If people can not saliva all day long, the essence will always stay, and the
color will not be haunted; Saliva is not as good as near saliva, and it is better not to saliva as near
saliva.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yanjin health preservation not only has a long history, but also conforms to modern science.
Modern medicine believes that, in addition to water, human saliva also contains amylase, lysozyme,
mucus protein, amino acids, and a small amount of sodium, calcium and other substances. It has
various physiological functions and is beneficial to digestion, health preservation, and body
strengthening. . In recent years, scientists have also discovered that saliva can disinfect, detoxify,
fight cancer and kill HIV.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Chinese ancient health preservationists attached great importance to pharyngeal fluid health
preservation. Taoists noticed the health-preserving function of pharyngeal fluid earlier. The “Huang
Ting Inner Jing Jing” of the Jin Dynasty talked about the function of saliva in many places. The
“Huang Ting Inner Jing Jing” mentioned that “the mouth is the Yuchi Taihe Palace. Evil jade
refines the face, and examines the cultivable Deng Guanghan”. These five sentences mean that the
mouth is the place where saliva is produced, and swallowing saliva can prevent diseases, prevent
diseases, and achieve the purpose of prolonging life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the specific methods of pharyngeal health maintenance, there are descriptions in some
health-preserving guide books of the past dynasties. The “Ba Duan Jin Daoyin Method” in “Zunsheng Bajian Yannian but Disease Jian” records the method of pharyngeal fluid: “Chilong stirs
the water and rinses the fluid for thirty-eight. After waiting against the water, rinse and swallow the
body fluid again. After three times, the spirit water is swallowed nine times. The swallowing
gurgles and the pulses are adjusted by themselves.” According to the Qing Dynasty Youcheng
“Shou Shi Qing Bian”, Yan Jin “lipped the tongue.” The upper palate will be filled with fluid for a
long time, and it will be swallowed, and the swallowing will make a sound, so that the five internal
organs can be irrigated and the fire can be reduced quickly. The number of swallows is better.”</p>

<p>I hope everyone use their naturally occuring “Elixir”. The human body has its own medicine. I eat “Elixir” every day. I attach great importance to the “Hua Chi Water” in my mouth. The elixir has a good recovery effect on all kinds of symptoms of sperm injury. It is also very effective in improving neurosis and brain power. Energy is doubled, but the cost is persistence. One typically starts at 15 minutes initially, it then slowly extends to each time. It then reaches half an hour and finally 45 minutes per session. I was able to recover from neurosis at that time, and it was inseparable from eating elixir. I was completely desperate for
medicine and it was very expensive. In the end, I relied on “eating elixir” and other health regimens.After more than half a year, I felt recovered. After more than a year, neurosis disappeared.</p>
