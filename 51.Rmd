# Rebooting is a war of ideas

## Preface {-}

If you advise an average person to practice abstinence, they may consider it an extreme approach. This misunderstanding often arises in ordinary individuals. The primary purpose of abstaining from sexual activity, as advocated, is to refrain from engaging in sex before marriage and to exercise self-control after marriage. The idea is to avoid premarital sex, preserve your best self for marriage, and maintain good physical conditions for procreation.

However, many people misinterpret this concept and lack a deep understanding of it. When they observe others practicing abstinence, they hastily assume that everyone doing so aims to become a monk. This is a significant misjudgment and a self-righteous stance. Jumping to conclusions without a thorough comprehension of the matter, they consider masturbation to be normal and acceptable. Their reasoning questions why people should suppress their desires.

Additionally, some people draw a parallel between the pleasures of food and those of sex. They perceive indulging in food for pleasure as akin to seeking pleasure through sexual activity. However, it's essential to recognize that this comparison doesn't justify indulgence or promiscuity. Instead, it emphasizes the need for moderation and restraint in both aspects of life.

The intention behind advocating abstinence is not to suppress one's sexual desires in a harmful manner. Sadly, many people misunderstand sexual appetite and use it as an excuse for excessive indulgence. This ignorance can lead to detrimental consequences, as masturbation depletes the body's vital essence, especially the precious kidney essence. In due course, the consequences of such actions will catch up, and individuals may face health issues.

The truth behind the importance of moderation and abstinence has been evident and verified for thousands of years. Those who attempt to challenge this wisdom by experimenting with their own bodies often suffer tragic outcomes.

This is the advice given by people who come here. Of course, some individuals who are stubborn and refuse to listen may find it hard to accept. They believe that masturbation brings great comfort, and they see no reason to quit. Such people can only learn through experiencing the consequences. Symptoms often serve as the most effective teachers. Unfortunately, some individuals with no proper understanding or good moral foundation may still not consider stopping even if they encounter adverse symptoms. They remain infatuated with their behavior and refuse to reflect on their actions, leading to regretful outcomes, much like hitting a wall and failing to turn back.

Certain individuals may argue that they've been masturbating for over a decade without major issues, aside from some tolerable physical discomforts. However, it's essential to understand that significant problems stem from seemingly minor ones, as most people have learned through life experiences. Some may think they are healthy until a medical examination reveals a serious illness that had been silently developing. Others may appear fine on the surface but suddenly pass away without warning.

The media has also highlighted the increasing number of sudden deaths among young and middle-aged people in our country. Shockingly, the statistics show that around 550,000 people die from sudden cardiac death annually, meaning that more than 1,000 people die suddenly each day.

In conclusion, the advice to refrain from masturbation is given with the intention of promoting overall well-being and preventing potential future health complications. It's essential to consider the long-term consequences of our actions and make informed decisions about our lifestyles.

On March 10th, World Kidney Day is observed, and this year's theme is "Protect the Kidney, Save the Heart." A few years back, nephrologists noticed a peculiar trend: many kidney disease patients were succumbing to heart disease before their kidney condition worsened. Surprisingly, while heart issues pose a significant health risk, people often overlook the importance of kidney health. Recent research has established a close link between heart disease and kidney disease, describing them as a pair of "difficult brothers."

The occurrence of kidney disease can expedite the progression of heart disease, and underlying heart risks may manifest as kidney ailments. This close connection between kidney and heart health has been affirmed by Western medicine research. Interestingly, in traditional Chinese medicine, the concept of kidney deficiency leading to heart problems has been acknowledged for a long time. When the balance of heart-kidney interaction is disrupted, heart-kidney dissociation may arise. As per the "heart-kidney correlation" theory, prolonged kidney deficiency can eventually impact the heart, leading to heart-related complications. Likewise, heart issues can exacerbate kidney disease, resulting in a pathological state where both organs are affected simultaneously.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the kidney is considered the root of the five internal organs. When the kidney is compromised, it can cause problems in the other organs as well. Factors like staying up late, overworking, or being overweight can potentially contribute to sudden and severe health issues. This is not an exaggeration but a call to stay vigilant and mindful of our well-being.

Many individuals I've spoken to have experienced discomfort in their hearts, including myself. I too encountered heart pain and palpitations. However, after rebooting for over six months, I gradually experienced improvements in my condition.

At times, our perceptions about our self are misleading. We might believe that we are fine, but in reality, we are gradually declining, edging closer to the tipping point of experiencing symptoms. Therefore, relying on luck is not a wise choice; instead, it is much wiser to completely abstain from masturbation.

The crucial first step is to eliminate any illusions in our minds and truly comprehend the harm caused by masturbation. We must correct any misconceptions we might have about rebooting in general. Some individuals engage in frequent sexual activities, pushing for intense desires and possessing robust physical health, but they fail to recognize that this behavior is a manifestation of hyperactivity. Little do they realize that their current excitement will lead to future issues like premature ejaculation and impotence. It's akin to a stock market bubble economy, a false sense of prosperity that will inevitably lead to a plunge and an economic crisis.

Similarly, after experiencing the consequences of imbalance between deficiency and hyperactivity in the body, crisis sets in, and symptoms begin to manifest. It is crucial to be mindful of these consequences and take responsible actions to safeguard our health and well-being.

>"Tao Te Ching": The sergeant hears the Tao, and works diligently; the sergeant hears the Tao, if it survives; the corporal hears the Tao, laughs, and it is not the Tao not to laugh.

The reality is that some individuals, especially those who lack understanding, may not only mock you but also criticize you for your choices. These people are often unqualified, using offensive language, and displaying a strong sense of self-righteousness. Such individuals are unlikely to embrace the concept of rebooting, as destiny plays a role, and not everyone is receptive to the idea, despite how compassionate you may be. In the journey of rebooting, you will come to realize that only a select few hold the complete truth and can fully comprehend the principles behind self-control.

Considering China's vast population of over a billion people, the number of individuals in the Reboot Bar community remains relatively small (a few hundred thousand). Even if it grows to several million, it will still represent a minority compared to the whole population. For a widespread adoption of the rebooting mindset, it would require the media to promote the awareness of harmful effects, popularize rebooting thoughts, and have these negative impacts acknowledged widely and entered into school's physiological hygiene manuals. As of now, China remains a place where the harmlessness theory prevails, and the hope is that controlling harmful habits will soon become a consensus embraced by the entire nation, similar to the warning written on cigarette boxes: "Smoking is harmful to health!"

Some individuals talk to their parents about rebooting. However, when parents hear about it, they often misunderstand the intention behind it. They might fear that their child wants to become a monk and worry about the potential loss of family inheritance. It is a reasonable concern for parents to have. If you try to explain to them that it's merely about abstinence, they might not be able to provide the correct guidance, especially if the previous generation lacked sex education or was influenced by misconceptions.

In some cases, fathers treat masturbation as a normal habit and fail to recognize the harmful effects of masturbation. Consequently, they unknowingly pass on the same misconceptions to their children, leading to incorrect guidance. Therefore, it would be best not to discuss rebooting with parents, particularly for all you younger brothers in junior high and high school. Parents still view you as immature and you will not be capable of making fully convincing arguments. Seeking parental support could lead to misunderstandings, potentially affecting one's commitment to abstaining.

Quitting is a matter of relative privacy, especially in a time when discussing such topics openly may lead to misconceptions. It is advisable to silently adhere to one's rebooting journey. There are plenty of like-minded brothers in the rebooting community who can offer encouragement and ample support.

## Q & A {-}

>Dear Teacher Feixiang,
I must confess that I am feeling quite defeated and overwhelmed. Despite reading countless materials on rebooting, I find myself becoming numb to the knowledge. Since mid-March of this year, I have experienced repeated relapses for 109 days, with none of these periods exceeding 20 days. I understand that I might not have the right to ask for guidance again, but I genuinely don't know what to do. Comparing my current self to the person I was when I began rebooting a year ago, I feel like I've lost my way. I have witnessed numerous cases of harm caused by excessive behaviors, and I recognize that my body is displaying several symptoms. However, I find myself detached and indifferent towards my own well-being, leaving me feeling lost and helpless.For instance, today, on the fifth day of my attempt to abstain, the desire suddenly and inexplicably became overpowering. I've noticed that this desire exists objectively, and I've unfortunately engaged in watching a lot of poisonous movies over the past few months. As a result, I've learned various ways to access such material, and I truly wish to forget them! Yet, whenever the desire arises, I cannot resist the urge to seek out poisonous content, and the temptations I encounter on a daily basis are incredibly intense. In short, I find it immensely challenging to stay on track.I am in desperate need of guidance and support. Any advice you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

**Response:** Many individuals have gone through experiences similar to yours. After the initial failure, it's common to lose the enthusiasm for rebooting, feel indifferent towards rebooting materials, and ultimately become demotivated and overtaken by the allure of the addiction. This can make you feel like a puppet under the influence of a demon. However, there's no need to be fearful when this happens. Repentance holds great power and can help save you. You can renew your determination and reclaim your rebooting state.

Developing a habit of studying and truly understanding the concepts is crucial. Merely skimming through rebooting articles without delving into their meaning and integrating them into your rebooting consciousness will not improve your consciousness. Keep a personal rebooting notebook, reading articles daily, making notes, and reviewing them consistently. By doing so, you can solidify your understanding and enlightenment, which will lead to genuine improvement.

Don't lose heart or get discouraged. Persevere in your efforts. Many individuals have experienced relapses, but they learned from those experiences and started again. You have the capability to do the same. Keep going!

**Side note:** When it comes to rebooting, many of us have experienced this process, including myself. I struggled to quit for many years, and I can be described as one of the long-term rebooters. Since junior high school, I have attempted to quit numerous times. I would successfully abstain for a maximum of 28 days, only to face a series of relapses afterward. This cycle continued until my body sent out serious warnings, prompting me to begin a new round of rebooting.

During those times, I made repeated attempts but couldn't overcome the demons that plagued me. I must admit that I didn't dedicate myself to studying and understanding the process at that time. However, through continuous learning and self-improvement, I came to realize that as I progressed like an elevator, the confrontation with the demons was no longer the same. I gained the ability to subdue the demon entirely and respond to all its challenges.

I once likened the process of rebooting to leveling up in a game. The old monster, the heart demon, appeared to be at level 100, while I was merely at level a dozen. The difference in strength was so vast that I could only be defeated by the heart demon. Whenever it appeared, I surrendered immediately. However, through persistent learning and increasing my awareness, I finally managed to subdue the demons.

In conclusion, the journey of rebooting requires continuous learning, self-awareness, and perseverance. Over time, we can gain the strength to overcome the challenges posed by the inner demons.

Some brothers are indeed learning, but they face challenges in continuously improving their consciousness. After studying for a period, they encounter a bottleneck in their consciousness improvement, and they also experience periods of fatigue with rebooting. Consequently, they become numb to rebooting articles and lose interest in taking notes, only giving them a casual look and forgetting the content shortly after reading. Initially, their consciousness improved significantly. For example, starting at level a dozen, they reached level 50 through learning, but the gap remains significant. To defeat the old demons, constant learning and ongoing improvement of consciousness are essential. There must be no relaxation in the demands they place on themselves.

One brother managed to reboot for 109 days, which is truly commendable, but then he experienced a period of fatigue with the rebooting process. In my previous article, I discussed the importance of psychological adjustment during such tiredness. It's quite common for many brothers to relapse during times of boredom. Nearly every brother goes through a period of rebooting fatigue, and I've experienced it too. During these times, I adjust my study workload, but I never stop studying. I maintain several rebooting notebooks, and I gain consciousness by taking notes, thinking, and comprehending on my own while jotting down the information. Thus, I strongly emphasize the significance of taking notes. Every brother should maintain their rebooting notebook, ensuring they take notes regularly and review their contents from time to time. Developing good study habits is crucial to overcoming the fatigue experienced during the rebooting process.

After many brothers fail for the first time, there is a pattern of experiencing a series of relapses. Without the original motivation and enthusiasm for rebooting, relapse indeed results in the loss of experience and morale. However, those with a strong will improve themselves by breaking the precepts. By doing so, they can identify the flaws in their consciousness and understand their deficiencies.

The misunderstandings and blind spots in their comprehension undoubtedly lead to being ensnared by the heart demon. Yet, the heart demon can be defeated by those who have unwavering resolve and provide correct answers to its questions. The heart demon acts as a strict examiner, and any incorrect response would undoubtedly result in a relapse.

Everyone has been a student at one point in time, and all students in a class study the same textbook, but the extent of their understanding varies. Some may have genuinely grasped the material, while others might have only gained a superficial or simple understanding without delving deep into the subject. The same principle applies to rebooting. When confronted by the heart demon, your level of enlightenment will be evident. Those with high enlightenment can pass the test, while those with imperfect enlightenment may easily break the precept.

Real gold is not afraid of fire, and similarly, when your consciousness is genuine and profound, you won't fear the challenges posed by the inner demon. Unfortunately, after being defeated by the heart demon, many brothers become its puppets once again, completely at its mercy and lacking freedom. The days of being under the influence of the heart demon are genuinely distressing and leave them feeling helpless.

To regain a good rebooting state, there are two approaches. Firstly, one may wait until awakened by symptoms again and then reboot out of fear, which is a more passive approach. Alternatively, showing sincere repentance holds great power, followed by making a strong determination to reboot. The key is to genuinely engage in learning and steadily raise awareness. By following this path, one can achieve a positive rebooting state.

Experiencing relapses is not the worst thing; what is truly the worst thing is giving up on learning and becoming disheartened by it. To illustrate, it's akin to the tale of the tortoise and the hare. The hare abandons the race midway, while the clever tortoise perseveres, steadily progressing. Eventually, the tortoise reaches the finish line. We ought to emulate the tortoise, continuously improving our consciousness at a gradual pace. The essential factor is perseverance, and with perseverance comes success.

Almost every brother will inevitably encounter the period of tiredness during the rebooting journey, and this phase tends to affect a significant number of individuals. However, those who successfully overcome this period can enter a more stable and positive rebooting state. For those brothers who have experienced setbacks, there is no need to be disheartened. After all, who among us has never relapsed? It's entirely possible to make a comeback!

Avoid being too hard on yourself and instead, refocus on your studies, seeking a good state of learning once more. Steadily raising your consciousness and committing fully to the process is crucial. Giving up on learning or becoming disinterested in it will indeed make the journey much more challenging. The key to success lies in persistently pursuing knowledge and growth.

People who only read rebooting articles once and show no interest in revisiting them will find it challenging to quit effectively. Merely reading an article once results in a superficial understanding, akin to glancing at a horse and then forgetting about it. While it might seem like they comprehend the material, they cannot express it in words.

Confucius advocated the practice of reviewing past learnings while embracing new knowledge. Valuable rebooting articles deserve repeated study. Taking notes and reviewing them consistently enhances the absorption rate. Each time one reads a quality rebooting article, they gain fresh insights and new knowledge. Those who read it once, twice, or five times experience different levels of enlightenment. Taking notes leads to a faster growth in consciousness compared to those who do not.

I suggest two key points: Firstly, read the articles multiple times and never tire of doing so. Secondly, take extensive notes and review them regularly. Implementing these practices will rapidly enhance one's consciousness. Brothers who lack interest in reading a second time must correct this habit. By repeatedly studying good rebooting articles, taking comprehensive notes, and thoroughly digesting the content, one can genuinely internalize the knowledge and transform it into their own rebooting consciousness.

Confucius left three remarkable stories that hold valuable lessons for everyone to learn. During the Spring and Autumn Period, Confucius displayed great eagerness for learning, and this enthusiasm persisted throughout his later years. He dedicated himself to studying the Book of Changes, diligently going through its contents. In his pursuit of understanding, he revisited the book numerous times, leading to the breaking of the cowhide belt of the bamboo slips three times.

As a result of his unwavering dedication, Confucius compiled ten articles that documented his research experience, known as the "Ten Wings." Subsequently, "Ten Wings" and the "Book of Changes" were combined, forming a complementary part of the "Book of Changes," as it stands in later generations. These stories serve as a testament to Confucius's commitment to learning and his profound impact on the study of the Book of Changes.

Improving your consciousness quickly can be achieved by engaging in various activities such as reading, researching, taking more notes, and contemplating independently. Merely reading an article once results in a superficial understanding. It is essential for everyone to delve deeply into rebooting articles, genuinely comprehend them, and assimilate the knowledge into their own rebooting consciousness.

Consistent dedication to this approach can bring significant progress in your journey towards complete rebooting. Persisting with this method for three months can lead to solid improvements in your consciousness. Consequently, you'll be able to create a significant gap between yourself and others. When confronted with the demons again, you will have the confidence to defeat them, at the very least, much stronger than before.

By continuously strengthening your consciousness, you will eventually gain the ability to completely subdue the demons. The process of learning to raise your consciousness and using it to overcome the demons is an ironclad principle of successful rebooting. Embracing this approach will lead you towards a successful and fulfilling rebooting journey. This is the iron law of successful rebooting.

>For a considerable period, I have been attempting to quit, but I also engaged in simultaneous masturbation and internet surfing at internet cafes. At times, I wondered if the issue lies not with masturbation but with excessive internet use. I've been persistently attributing the problem to prolonged internet surfing, causing me great distress. Despite holding on, I often experience insomnia, and these thoughts constantly haunt me. Perhaps, after nearly two years of abstinence, I have not genuinely encountered the symptoms associated with quitting. I haven't truly experienced the sensations of symptoms.
In summary, I find myself swayed by the harmlessness theory. I consistently link the problem to my prolonged internet usage and sitting for extended periods, contributing to my daily struggle with insomnia. I sincerely seek help and guidance to address these challenges.

**Answer**: Well, long periods spent surfing the internet will definitely hurt your body and health.This is because sitting for prolonged periods of time damages your kidneys and spleen. Staring for prolonged periods damages the liver. Masturbation damages the kidneys as well. 

**Additional comment**: It is advisable to quit before the symptoms emerge. However, many individuals lack strong determination and only begin to quit once symptoms manifest. There are those with good roots who can successfully reboot without experiencing severe symptoms, setting a positive precedent. They choose not to wait until symptoms become overwhelming, as this passive approach can be challenging to recover from. Some may believe that the more severe the symptoms, the higher the chance of successful rebooting, but this notion is not valid. I have spoken with many brothers who, despite undergoing major surgeries, resumed sexual activities shortly after the operation. Even though they knew it was a serious condition caused by the surgery, they couldn't control their impulses. This highlights the human weakness of forgetting pain once the scars have healed.The key to successful rebooting lies in adopting a professional approach and learning to increase one's consciousness. Blindly attempting to reboot without proper knowledge and understanding makes success difficult, regardless of the depth of injury. By following the path of professional rebooting and enhancing one's consciousness, there is a higher likelihood of successful rebooting without the need for deep injuries or setbacks.

>Brother Feixiang, I have been masturbating for 10 years, am unmarried and 25 years old. The last time I masturbated was probably around February this year. One day, I found myself experiencing an inexplicable fear, almost like a phobia. I became overly sensitive to body odors, including my own and others', such as breath and sweat. Whenever I was near people, this uncontrollable fear would overwhelm me. I wonder if this heightened reaction is a normal part of the withdrawal process. It makes me think that maybe my rebooting hasn't been thorough enough. I have just started quitting, but lust often appears in my mind (everytime I get lust, I do other things to divert my attention). Even though I have friendly colleagues and a stable job, I find myself feeling unhappy, particularly when I need to stand in front of others. The fear I experience in such situations makes me very uncomfortable. I am reaching out for help, as I am genuinely grateful for any assistance you can provide. Thank you in advance for your support; it means a lot to me.

**Answer**: According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, the kidney is associated with governing fear. When there is a deficiency in the kidney, phobias can arise, and social fear is a common manifestation. It is not uncommon for many individuals to experience inexplicable fear after being injured through masturbation. Of course, there are other ways to injure the kidneys as well such as masturbation, sex with your girlfriend, staying up late, sitting for long periods and getting angry. Keep going!

**Addtional Note**: There are many physical symptoms caused by masturbation as wel as many psychological symptoms. Masturbation is double torture to the body and the mind. People who masturbate are prone to psychological issues like inferiority, fear, anxiety, paranoia, compulsion and irritability etc. In short, it can lead to a unhealthy and disordered psychological environment. Many brothers report that after sex/masturbation they become very irritable and angry and tend to quarrel with others, especially parents. this is one of the typical manifestations of patients with injured sperm and kidneys. There are also many brothers who have very low self esteem. Phobias are also relatively common. brothers will feel inexplicably fearful if the kidney qi is insufficient. This kind of fear is generally not understood by people. It is due to the injury of essence. In Western medicine it will be classified as mental illness. But in truth mental illness is very closely related to physiology. The kidney governs fear. When the kidney is injured to a certain extent, the psychological state of fear is likely to appear. Of course, there are some who are inherently timid and coupled with masturbation abuse become more prone to phobias and paranoid disorders. This case in particular also revealed a truth i.e. we must completely abstain from sex. What is thoroughness? When even the idea of obscenity does not enter our head. Although some people abstain from masturbation and sex abuse, they still have a lot of obscene contents in their head. This is a hidden emission. Over time, it will cause symptoms to break out. Indulging in obscene thoughts can lead to physical injury. There is no harm in breaking away completely, the key is to break away quickly!

## Main Topic {-}

In this season, I plan to delve into the theme of "rebooting as a war of thoughts" and provide a comprehensive explanation of rebooting from a mental perspective. My aim is to offer you a clearer and more focused understanding of the rebooting process.

In essence, rebooting is about learning to observe our own thoughts and then gaining control over them.

Rebooting is a battle of two opposing thoughts within ourselves. On one side, we have the thought of rebooting, the desire to stay committed and abstain from harmful behaviors. On the other side, there's the evil thought, the temptation to give in and indulge in injurious habits.

Many individuals struggle with conflicting thoughts before breaking their vows. These two opposing thoughts engage in a tug-of-war within their minds, and the ultimate outcome depends on which thought prevails. Unfortunately, some succumb to the evil thoughts, leading to relapses.

On the other hand, some individuals are quick to surrender to their evil thoughts without putting up a fight. They lack resistance and easily give in to temptation, just like a city without defenses that immediately falls to the enemy.

To succeed in rebooting, we must strengthen our mental defenses by continuously studying rebooting articles. It is like fortifying our city's walls to prevent evil thoughts from entering. When we notice evil thoughts trying to climb the walls of our mind, we must be vigilant and weed them out immediately. By actively engaging in this mental battle, we can increase our chances of successfully rebooting and staying on the path to self-improvement.

**Enemy**: Demon (obscene, instigated thoughts, thoughts about trying etc)

**Our side**: Righteous thoughts (Rebooting thoughts gained by increasing our awareness and understanding by learning)

The heart demon serves as the enemy's commander, and evil thoughts stem from it. Its primary aim is to foster obscenity, making it crucial for us to remain extra vigilant against its instigations. Buddhism advocates "subduing one's mind," which essentially involves conquering evil thoughts and vanquishing demons. While Buddhism addresses a broader range of qualities to be subdued, such as greed, anger, ignorance, and suspicion, in the context of rebooting, our focus lies in subduing the desire for greed and sex. However, at a more advanced level, we must learn to subdue all aspects of greed, anger, ignorance, and suspicion, as rebooting also involves cultivating morality and virtue, allowing us to attain a higher spiritual state.

After experiencing a setback in rebooting, some brothers may feel disheartened, as if they've lost a battle, leading to discouragement. However, the key to overcoming these inner demons is to continuously increase our awareness through learning and equip our minds with rebooting knowledge. Failing this time doesn't mean defeat; instead, it's an opportunity to learn, grow, and gather valuable experience and lessons.

We must persistently challenge the formidable heart demon. Don't be afraid and continue learning and progressing. It might seem that the demon is invincible, but in reality, it's not. To conquer it, we must become even stronger than the heart demon itself. This journey may have its frustrations, but we must remain brave and steadfast, not allowing temporary setbacks to deter us from our ultimate goal. With determination and resilience, we will eventually find the strength to subdue the heart demon and achieve successful rebooting.

Master Da'an emphasizes that cultivating the Tao is essentially cultivating the mind, which involves cultivating our thoughts. Similarly, in the context of rebooting, we are also engaged in the process of cultivating our minds and thoughts. However, many brothers might not fully comprehend what it means to cultivate the mind.

In essence, the "mind" refers to our thoughts and mental state. Before indulgence and exposure to harmful influences, our thoughts are relatively pure, like a clear mountain spring free from pollution. But as we are exposed to dirty content or associate with evil friends, our thoughts become contaminated. Our thoughts are interconnected like a flowing river, and if we constantly dwell on impure content, it will pollute the purity of our inner world.

The pollution of our inner river of thoughts can manifest externally in various ways. For instance, continuous indulgence can lead to a gloomy appearance, feelings of inferiority, lack of vitality, and even physical discomforts and facial deformities. Our body and mind are intricately linked, and the state of our mind directly influences our overall well-being.

To improve our rebooting journey, it is crucial to focus on cultivating our thoughts and maintaining the purity of our inner river. By avoiding harmful influences, negative content, and surrounding ourselves with positive and uplifting experiences, we can strive for a clear and revitalized mental state, ultimately contributing to our overall physical and mental well-being.

When impurity taints the heart, the body may emit unpleasant odors, remember the body and mind are interlinked. From the cases I've gathered, several brothers have experienced bodily odors like body odor, sweat odor, foot odor, bad breath, and nasal odor more frequently.

**Case 1**: Over the span of 4 to 5 years, I've engaged in excessive masturbation, often occurring once a day. This habit has led to physical discomforts like back pain, overall body weakness, and persistent fatigue. Notably, I've noticed changes in my body, with the emergence of slight sweat and body odor. My digestion has also taken a hit, causing bloating after meals. Furthermore, I've experienced rapid erection and ejaculation. I'm left wondering if this falls under the category of premature ejaculation or points towards kidney deficiency. If it's indeed kidney-related, I'm curious whether the deficiency lies in yang or yin. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring the potential connection to azoospermia and understanding its underlying causes.

**Case 2**: I started masturbating when I was 13 years old! Its everyday or every other day. After 1 year of masturbation I have started feeling maladjusted. I have back aches and pains. More health problems keeps arising of which increased sweating and body odor are a couple. I don't have any history of body odor so it must be a result of masturbation.

**Case 3**: I have aback aches and pains and my brain feels blank. I easily sweat and get terrible body odor. Why has God brought all these misfortunes on me? I didn't masturbate for half a month and then broke the reboot. Now I have contracted tinea cruris ("jock-itch"). Did I fucking do somethign wrong in my past life that I now have to pay it back? I can't seem to quit and my life is over! Please don't masturbate, plase don't be like me.

Masturbation leads to endocrine disorders and dysfunction of the five internal organs. People who don't have body odor will start getting body odor. I also had sweat-induced odor and really bad feet odor. Now that I have quit completely I don't smell anymore, even when I sweat.

"Rebooting is fragrant, keep rebooting and keep healthy. Control nocturnal emissions. This will restore your natural frangrance, just like the fragrance of a child, it is the fragrance of the soul"

Studying rebooting articles strengthens mindfulness, a crucial defense against the powerful grip of the mind demon. Despite the mind demon's strength, it's not unbeatable. Similar to online games, consistent leveling (elevating awareness) allows you to ultimately triumph over these inner battles. The journey parallels gaming progress – from a rookie to facing your inner demon head-on, culminating in its complete surrender.

Forsaking learning or growing weary weakens your consciousness, making it vulnerable to demon assaults. Rebooting is about leveling up your consciousness – daily article study, note-taking, and review all contribute. Strengthening righteous thoughts is key; they become invincible shields against evil thoughts and your personal demons. Much like a spring, the heart golem weakens when confronted with your strengthened resolve. Becoming stronger is your only path forward.

The elderly sage emphasizes that the function of reciting Buddha is to sever delusions, while the sacred Buddha name acts as a sword of wisdom.

Reciting the Buddha serves as a method to sever delusional thoughts and replace them with a singular focus. The weapon at your disposal is the Buddha's name, akin to a finely honed sword. When delusions arise, they are swiftly identified and cut through, employing the principle of "think and break." Essentially, "not following" means coming to a halt. This involves disregarding delusions and refusing to indulge in them, a task that many find challenging initially. Through continuous mindfulness practice and heightened inner awareness, one can gradually attain this ability. Fornication is quick a ruthless, but to hold onto the Buddha's name is to cut off delusions. With intention, thoughts can be broken, much like slicing through with the Buddha's name. An alternative mantra is "When thoughts arise, halt and do not follow; when thoughts emerge, remain detached."

When your consciousness is feeble, confronting demons resembles a child's tug of war against an adult, yielding defeat.
As your awareness intensifies, facing demons equates to a tug of war between a teenager and an adult, a fight still ending in loss.
With greater enlightenment, battling demons mirrors an adult-to-adult tug of war, prolonging the struggle but potential defeat persists.
Upon becoming a Hercules, confronting inner demons brings fearlessness, causing the inner demon to cower; victory is within reach.
However, post-Hercules, unwavering vigilance is crucial, as relaxing it may still allow the inner demon to prevail.

Rebooting signifies a thought war and a tug of war. Both analogies are vivid, demanding fortified righteous thoughts to vanquish inner evil.
