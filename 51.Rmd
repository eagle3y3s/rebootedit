# Rebooting is a war of ideas

## Preface

If you advise an average person to practice abstinence, they may consider it an extreme approach. This misunderstanding often arises in ordinary individuals. The primary purpose of abstaining from sexual activity, as advocated, is to refrain from engaging in sex before marriage and to exercise self-control after marriage. The idea is to avoid premarital sex, preserve your best self for marriage, and maintain good physical conditions for procreation.

However, many people misinterpret this concept and lack a deep understanding of it. When they observe others practicing abstinence, they hastily assume that everyone doing so aims to become a monk. This is a significant misjudgment and a self-righteous stance. Jumping to conclusions without a thorough comprehension of the matter, they consider masturbation to be normal and acceptable. Their reasoning questions why people should suppress their desires.

Additionally, some people draw a parallel between the pleasures of food and those of sex. They perceive indulging in food for pleasure as akin to seeking pleasure through sexual activity. However, it's essential to recognize that this comparison doesn't justify indulgence or promiscuity. Instead, it emphasizes the need for moderation and restraint in both aspects of life.

The intention behind advocating abstinence is not to suppress one's sexual desires in a harmful manner. Sadly, many people misunderstand sexual appetite and use it as an excuse for excessive indulgence. This ignorance can lead to detrimental consequences, as masturbation depletes the body's vital essence, especially the precious kidney essence. In due course, the consequences of such actions will catch up, and individuals may face health issues.

The truth behind the importance of moderation and abstinence has been evident and verified for thousands of years. Those who attempt to challenge this wisdom by experimenting with their own bodies often suffer tragic outcomes.

This is the advice given by people who come here. Of course, some individuals who are stubborn and refuse to listen may find it hard to accept. They believe that masturbation brings great comfort, and they see no reason to quit. Such people can only learn through experiencing the consequences. Symptoms often serve as the most effective teachers. Unfortunately, some individuals with no proper understanding or good moral foundation may still not consider stopping even if they encounter adverse symptoms. They remain infatuated with their behavior and refuse to reflect on their actions, leading to regretful outcomes, much like hitting a wall and failing to turn back.

Certain individuals may argue that they've been masturbating for over a decade without major issues, aside from some tolerable physical discomforts. However, it's essential to understand that significant problems stem from seemingly minor ones, as most people have learned through life experiences. Some may think they are healthy until a medical examination reveals a serious illness that had been silently developing. Others may appear fine on the surface but suddenly pass away without warning.

The media has also highlighted the increasing number of sudden deaths among young and middle-aged people in our country. Shockingly, the statistics show that around 550,000 people die from sudden cardiac death annually, meaning that more than 1,000 people die suddenly each day.

In conclusion, the advice to refrain from masturbation is given with the intention of promoting overall well-being and preventing potential future health complications. It's essential to consider the long-term consequences of our actions and make informed decisions about our lifestyles.

On March 10th, World Kidney Day is observed, and this year's theme is "Protect the Kidney, Save the Heart." A few years back, nephrologists noticed a peculiar trend: many kidney disease patients were succumbing to heart disease before their kidney condition worsened. Surprisingly, while heart issues pose a significant health risk, people often overlook the importance of kidney health. Recent research has established a close link between heart disease and kidney disease, describing them as a pair of "difficult brothers."

The occurrence of kidney disease can expedite the progression of heart disease, and underlying heart risks may manifest as kidney ailments. This close connection between kidney and heart health has been affirmed by Western medicine research. Interestingly, in traditional Chinese medicine, the concept of kidney deficiency leading to heart problems has been acknowledged for a long time. When the balance of heart-kidney interaction is disrupted, heart-kidney dissociation may arise. As per the "heart-kidney correlation" theory, prolonged kidney deficiency can eventually impact the heart, leading to heart-related complications. Likewise, heart issues can exacerbate kidney disease, resulting in a pathological state where both organs are affected simultaneously.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the kidney is considered the root of the five internal organs. When the kidney is compromised, it can cause problems in the other organs as well. Factors like staying up late, overworking, or being overweight can potentially contribute to sudden and severe health issues. This is not an exaggeration but a call to stay vigilant and mindful of our well-being.

Many individuals I've spoken to have experienced discomfort in their hearts, including myself. I too encountered heart pain and palpitations. However, after rebooting for over six months, I gradually experienced improvements in my condition.

At times, our perceptions about our self are misleading. We might believe that we are fine, but in reality, we are gradually declining, edging closer to the tipping point of experiencing symptoms. Therefore, relying on luck is not a wise choice; instead, it is much wiser to completely abstain from masturbation.

The crucial first step is to eliminate any illusions in our minds and truly comprehend the harm caused by masturbation. We must correct any misconceptions we might have about rebooting in general. Some individuals engage in frequent sexual activities, pushing for intense desires and possessing robust physical health, but they fail to recognize that this behavior is a manifestation of hyperactivity. Little do they realize that their current excitement will lead to future issues like premature ejaculation and impotence. It's akin to a stock market bubble economy, a false sense of prosperity that will inevitably lead to a plunge and an economic crisis.

Similarly, after experiencing the consequences of imbalance between deficiency and hyperactivity in the body, crisis sets in, and symptoms begin to manifest. It is crucial to be mindful of these consequences and take responsible actions to safeguard our health and well-being.

The reality is that some individuals, especially those who lack understanding, may not only mock you but also criticize you for your choices. These people are often unqualified, using offensive language, and displaying a strong sense of self-righteousness. Such individuals are unlikely to embrace the concept of rebooting, as destiny plays a role, and not everyone is receptive to the idea, despite how compassionate you may be. In the journey of rebooting, you will come to realize that only a select few hold the complete truth and can fully comprehend the principles behind self-control.

Considering China's vast population of over a billion people, the number of individuals in the Reboot Bar community remains relatively small (a few hundred thousand). Even if it grows to several million, it will still represent a minority compared to the whole population. For a widespread adoption of the rebooting mindset, it would require the media to promote the awareness of harmful effects, popularize rebooting thoughts, and have these negative impacts acknowledged widely and entered into school's physiological hygiene manuals. As of now, China remains a place where the harmlessness theory prevails, and the hope is that controlling harmful habits will soon become a consensus embraced by the entire nation, similar to the warning written on cigarette boxes: "Smoking is harmful to health!"

Some individuals talk to their parents about rebooting. However, when parents hear about it, they often misunderstand the intention behind it. They might fear that their child wants to become a monk and worry about the potential loss of family inheritance. It is a reasonable concern for parents to have. If you try to explain to them that it's merely about abstinence, they might not be able to provide the correct guidance, especially if the previous generation lacked sex education or was influenced by misconceptions.

In some cases, fathers treat masturbation as a normal habit and fail to recognize the harmful effects of masturbation. Consequently, they unknowingly pass on the same misconceptions to their children, leading to incorrect guidance. Therefore, it would be best not to discuss rebooting with parents, particularly for all you younger brothers in junior high and high school. Parents still view you as immature and you will not be capable of making fully convincing arguments. Seeking parental support could lead to misunderstandings, potentially affecting one's commitment to abstaining.

Quitting is a matter of relative privacy, especially in a time when discussing such topics openly may lead to misconceptions. It is advisable to silently adhere to one's rebooting journey. There are plenty of like-minded brothers in the rebooting community who can offer encouragement and ample support.

## Q & A

>Dear Teacher Feixiang,
I must confess that I am feeling quite defeated and overwhelmed. Despite reading countless materials on rebooting, I find myself becoming numb to the knowledge. Since mid-March of this year, I have experienced repeated relapses for 109 days, with none of these periods exceeding 20 days. I understand that I might not have the right to ask for guidance again, but I genuinely don't know what to do. Comparing my current self to the person I was when I began rebooting a year ago, I feel like I've lost my way. I have witnessed numerous cases of harm caused by excessive behaviors, and I recognize that my body is displaying several symptoms. However, I find myself detached and indifferent towards my own well-being, leaving me feeling lost and helpless.For instance, today, on the fifth day of my attempt to abstain, the desire suddenly and inexplicably became overpowering. I've noticed that this desire exists objectively, and I've unfortunately engaged in watching a lot of poisonous movies over the past few months. As a result, I've learned various ways to access such material, and I truly wish to forget them! Yet, whenever the desire arises, I cannot resist the urge to seek out poisonous content, and the temptations I encounter on a daily basis are incredibly intense. In short, I find it immensely challenging to stay on track.I am in desperate need of guidance and support. Any advice you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

**Response:** Many individuals have gone through experiences similar to yours. After the initial failure, it's common to lose the enthusiasm for rebooting, feel indifferent towards rebooting materials, and ultimately become demotivated and overtaken by the allure of the addiction. This can make you feel like a puppet under the influence of a demon. However, there's no need to be fearful when this happens. Repentance holds great power and can help save you. You can renew your determination and reclaim your rebooting state.

Developing a habit of studying and truly understanding the concepts is crucial. Merely skimming through rebooting articles without delving into their meaning and integrating them into your rebooting consciousness will not improve your consciousness. Keep a personal rebooting notebook, reading articles daily, making notes, and reviewing them consistently. By doing so, you can solidify your understanding and enlightenment, which will lead to genuine improvement.

Don't lose heart or get discouraged. Persevere in your efforts. Many individuals have experienced relapses, but they learned from those experiences and started again. You have the capability to do the same. Keep going!

**Side note:** When it comes to rebooting, many of us have experienced this process, including myself. I struggled to quit for many years, and I can be described as one of the long-term rebooters. Since junior high school, I have attempted to quit numerous times. I would successfully abstain for a maximum of 28 days, only to face a series of relapses afterward. This cycle continued until my body sent out serious warnings, prompting me to begin a new round of rebooting.

During those times, I made repeated attempts but couldn't overcome the demons that plagued me. I must admit that I didn't dedicate myself to studying and understanding the process at that time. However, through continuous learning and self-improvement, I came to realize that as I progressed like an elevator, the confrontation with the demons was no longer the same. I gained the ability to subdue the demon entirely and respond to all its challenges.

I once likened the process of rebooting to leveling up in a game. The old monster, the heart demon, appeared to be at level 100, while I was merely at level a dozen. The difference in strength was so vast that I could only be defeated by the heart demon. Whenever it appeared, I surrendered immediately. However, through persistent learning and increasing my awareness, I finally managed to subdue the demons.

In conclusion, the journey of rebooting requires continuous learning, self-awareness, and perseverance. Over time, we can gain the strength to overcome the challenges posed by the inner demons.

Some brothers are indeed learning, but they face challenges in continuously improving their consciousness. After studying for a period, they encounter a bottleneck in their consciousness improvement, and they also experience periods of fatigue with rebooting. Consequently, they become numb to rebooting articles and lose interest in taking notes, only giving them a casual look and forgetting the content shortly after reading. Initially, their consciousness improved significantly. For example, starting at level a dozen, they reached level 50 through learning, but the gap remains significant. To defeat the old demons, constant learning and ongoing improvement of consciousness are essential. There must be no relaxation in the demands they place on themselves.

One brother managed to reboot for 109 days, which is truly commendable, but then he experienced a period of fatigue with the rebooting process. In my previous article, I discussed the importance of psychological adjustment during such tiredness. It's quite common for many brothers to relapse during times of boredom. Nearly every brother goes through a period of rebooting fatigue, and I've experienced it too. During these times, I adjust my study workload, but I never stop studying. I maintain several rebooting notebooks, and I gain consciousness by taking notes, thinking, and comprehending on my own while jotting down the information. Thus, I strongly emphasize the significance of taking notes. Every brother should maintain their rebooting notebook, ensuring they take notes regularly and review their contents from time to time. Developing good study habits is crucial to overcoming the fatigue experienced during the rebooting process.
